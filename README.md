Master thesis using machine learning to predict fouling in heat exchangers

High-level Machine Learning API is implemented in api.py
For examples of usage, see the example_X_basic.ipynb notebooks

There is also a high-level Statistics API implemented in statApi.py
Some of this functionality is implemented in example_pca_duo_plot.ipynb, while more will follow shortly

For more advanced usage, the high-level API can be combined with use of the underlying API, as shown in some additional notebooks, e.g.
- example_predict_with_uncertainty.ipynb
- example_pca_duo_plot.ipynb
- example_X_features_comparison.ipynb
- (more will follow shortly)

Most methods of the underlying API is located at src/utils/XXXX.py
There are also some runable .py files for popular methods such as printing, plotting etc, although not entirely up to date at this point.
